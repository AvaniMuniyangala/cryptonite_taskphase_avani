# Hello Hackers

## Intro to Commands 

Here we are asked to run a simple whoami command which just prints the username to the terminal window. It prints out "hacker".
```
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ whoami
hacker
```
 We are then asked to run the hello command to recieve the flag which is the main goal of the challenge.
 ```
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{sG4emQT_aTf3aFvYccmhfLTcW7C.ddjNyUDLygDO0czW}
```

 ## Intro to Arguments 
 This challenge introduces us to arguments on Linux. An argument is additional data passed onto a command.
 In this challenge in order to obtain the flag we are asked to run the hello command with hackers as an argument 
 ```
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ hello hackers
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{wgHzdNiQc3NW-bu0-yI-rzZ4ZXT.dhjNyUDLygDO0czW}
```
And that's the end of the first module.
