# Practicing Piping
## Redirecting output
The syntax for redirecting files is ```hacker@dojo:~$ echo hi > asdf```
Using the syntax knowledge we can easily retrieve the flag.
```
hacker@piping~redirecting-output:~$ echo PWN > COLLEGE
Correct! You successfully redirected 'PWN' to the file 'COLLEGE'! Here is your 
flag:
pwn.college{chsa2J51RXXRy8xcxo7A-TLc9FP.dRjN1QDLygDO0czW}
```
## Redirecting more output 
In thsi challenge we are asked to redirect the output of ```/challenge/run``` to ```myflag```
```
hacker@piping~redirecting-more-output:~$ /challenge/run > myflag

When you do not do that this happens:
```
hacker@piping~redirecting-more-output:~$ /challenge/run
