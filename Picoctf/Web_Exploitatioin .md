## cookies 
So the first thing i did was submit ```snickerdoodle```.
Got the response ```I love snickerdoodle cookies!```.
Next problem. 
I dont know names of any cookies. So i looked up and tested out differrent cookies just to see what would happen.
As long as i input an actual cookie name Id be redirected to ```http://mercury.picoctf.net:29649/check``` but if i put non cookie names 
I got the response ``` that doesnt appear to be a valid cookie ```.
So i inspected the page. 
Applications and cookies and lo and behold.<br>

I tried inputing different cookie names now.
```shortbread``` changed the value to four.
```chocolate chip``` value 1.
Now i have to test out different values of cookies on burp suite to find one that would give us the flag.
Set up my browser to use burp suite. Sent the url from proxy to repeater.
While in repeater I changed the name=(value) to different values.
Each value corresponds to a different cookie (12 is spritz cookie). <br>

Value 18 gave me the flag

## Forbidden Paths
In this challenge we are linked to a Web eReader.
The description says that the website is filtering absolute file paths. So we use ```././``` which would be a relative path. After trying out a couple variations 
```
./flag.txt
././flag.txt
./././flag.txt
```
Noticed that wasnt working and then say that the website had four things listed one of which was ```..```.
Which led to
```
../flag.txt
../../flag.txt
```
```../../../flag.txt``` provided the flag 
```picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_e5a6fcbc}```
